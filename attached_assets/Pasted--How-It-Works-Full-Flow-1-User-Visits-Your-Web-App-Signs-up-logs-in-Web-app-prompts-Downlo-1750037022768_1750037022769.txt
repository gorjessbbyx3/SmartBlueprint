🔁 How It Works (Full Flow)
1. User Visits Your Web App
Signs up / logs in

Web app prompts: “Download the local agent to scan your network and control your smart devices.”

2. User Installs the Agent
Electron app, Python/Go binary, or lightweight CLI

Installer requests local network permissions and optionally admin/sudo if needed (e.g. for arp-scan)

3. Agent Authenticates with the Cloud
At first run, agent asks user to sign in with their account or paste a pairing token from web app

Secure connection is created:

MQTT over TLS

or WebSocket over WSS

or fallback to HTTPS polling

4. Agent Starts Monitoring
Discovers devices:

via arp-scan, nmap, mDNS/SSDP, etc.

Reads WiFi signal:

via iwlist / nmcli / netsh wlan (platform-specific)

Reports data to cloud, e.g.:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "mac": "XX:XX:XX:XX",
  "ip": "192.168.1.35",
  "rssi": -61,
  "device_type": "smart_plug",
  "vendor": "TP-Link",
  "last_seen": "2025-06-16T19:00Z"
}
5. Web App UI Updates in Real-Time
Shows:

Device list

WiFi map (floor plan overlay)

Online/offline states

Control switches (on/off, etc.)

🔐 Security Best Practices
Concern	How to Handle
Agent access to LAN	Limit to read-only unless user opts in
Authentication	Use OAuth2 token exchange or pairing code (like Tailscale/Home Assistant Cloud)
TLS encryption	Required for all traffic between agent and cloud
Agent updates	Use signed auto-updater (e.g. for Electron or Python/PyInstaller builds)

🧰 Agent: What It Needs to Do
Feature	Tool or Method
WiFi signal scan	nmcli (Linux), netsh wlan (Windows), airport (Mac)
LAN scan	nmap, arp-scan, ip neigh
Smart device control	via MQTT, REST, or vendor SDKs (TP-Link Kasa, Hue, etc.)
Tunnel to web app	MQTT client (paho-mqtt, async-mqtt), WebSocket client
OS packaging	Electron + Node, or Python with pyinstaller, or Go binary

🌐 Web App’s Job
Securely store and associate agent device info with user accounts

Provide real-time dashboard:

“Room A has 4 devices, avg RSSI: -60 dBm”

“Thermostat last seen 1 min ago”

Let users:

View network stats

Control smart devices

Run network tests or scans

Show agent status:

Online/offline

Last heartbeat time

📦 What to Ship
Deliverable	Tool Recommendation
Desktop Agent (multi-platform)	Electron + Node.js or Python (with PyInstaller) or Golang
Cloud backend	FastAPI, Node.js (Nest.js or Express), Django
MQTT broker	Mosquitto (self-hosted), EMQX, or Cloud (HiveMQ, AWS IoT)
UI stack	React + Leaflet/Konva for map overlays, MQTT over WebSocket

🧪 Optional Enhancements
Auto-update floor plan heatmaps via user tapping "scan here"

Let users name and tag devices

Show network bottlenecks or overlap (e.g., 2.4GHz congestion)

Offer smart alerts ("new device joined", "RSSI below -80 in Bedroom")

✅ TL;DR – Yes, Here's How You Do It:
✅ Users download a local desktop agent
✅ The agent connects securely to your web app’s backend
✅ It scans devices and WiFi, then streams updates to the cloud
✅ Web app shows real-time WiFi map + smart devices
✅ All control commands from cloud are relayed via the agent

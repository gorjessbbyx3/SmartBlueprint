# SmartBlueprint Pro - Smart Home Device Mapping Platform

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for smart home device mapping and network optimization. The platform provides real-time visualization of IoT devices on interactive floorplans, analyzes signal strength patterns, and offers intelligent recommendations for improving network coverage. Built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL, it features a modern component-based architecture with real-time WebSocket communication.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **Wouter** for client-side routing
- **WebSocket** integration for real-time device updates

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **WebSocket Server** for real-time communication
- **Drizzle ORM** for database operations
- **Zod** for runtime type validation
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database (configured for Neon)

### Database Design
- **devices** table: Stores device information including position, signal strength, and status

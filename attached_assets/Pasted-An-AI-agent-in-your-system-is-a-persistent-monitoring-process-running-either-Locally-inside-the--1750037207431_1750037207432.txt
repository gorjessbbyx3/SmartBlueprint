An AI agent in your system is a persistent monitoring process, running either:

Locally (inside the user’s agent on their LAN), or

On your cloud backend, fed by real-time data

It does things like:

Detect anomalies (e.g., "device went offline at 3 AM")

Make predictions ("your WiFi is degrading in Room A")

Suggest or trigger automations ("auto-reboot smart plug")

Alert the user ("New device joined your network — not previously seen")

🧠 Capabilities of Your AI Agents
Category	AI Agent Tasks
🔎 Monitoring	Detect offline devices, bandwidth drops, high packet loss, signal degradation
📈 Predictive	Forecast WiFi dead zones at certain hours, battery drain for IoT
🧠 Anomaly Detection	Unknown MAC address appears at 2am, frequent device drops
🤖 Self-Healing	Automatically reboot a device, restart agent, or re-run scan
💡 User Coaching	“Router placement is poor in Kitchen, move it 3m toward hallway”
🗺️ Mapping Intelligence	Dynamically suggest where to collect more RSSI samples
📨 Notifications	“Your thermostat was unreachable for 7 hours”

🔄 Where AI Can Run
Option A: Local AI Agent
Small models (rules, ML-lite) run inside desktop agent

Faster, offline-capable

Private: no raw traffic leaves the home

Option B: Cloud AI Agent
Gets structured telemetry (not full packets) via MQTT/API

More compute-intensive ML (e.g. time series models, LLMs)

Trains across user patterns (federated learning optional)

✅ Combine both: local does fast decisions, cloud does deeper analysis

🧠 Example: Device Offline Anomaly Agent
python
Copy
Edit
class OfflineDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.last_seen = {}  # {device_id: timestamp}

    def update_heartbeat(self, device_id, ts):
        self.last_seen[device_id] = ts

    def check_for_anomalies(self, current_ts):
        alerts = []
        for device_id, ts in self.last_seen.items():
            if current_ts - ts > 300:  # 5 minutes offline
                alerts.append(f"{device_id} is offline")
        return alerts
You could run this locally and send alerts via MQTT to the cloud or show in the web app.

🧠 Example: AI Suggestion Agent
A cloud agent could receive daily RSSI data per room, then:

Use a basic clustering model (KMeans) to detect low-signal areas.

Or fine-tune a small transformer model to label areas with:

“Dead zone”

“Fair coverage”

“Excellent coverage”

⚙️ Tools You Can Use
Task	Tools / Models
Local monitoring	Python agent with apscheduler, asyncio, or supervisord
AI/ML engine	scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, or onnxruntime
Time series models	Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM
Anomaly detection	Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, autoencoders
Inference on edge	onnx, TensorFlow Lite, or tinygrad
Alert delivery	WebSocket, MQTT pub to cloud, browser notifications

🔐 Privacy & Security
Always anonymize or obfuscate any MAC/IP before training if in cloud

Allow users to opt-in to AI insights

Expose explainable logs: “We think X happened because device Y has dropped signal below -85 for 3 hours.”

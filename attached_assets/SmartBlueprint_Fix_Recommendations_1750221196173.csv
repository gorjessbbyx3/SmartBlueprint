Area,Current Status,Recommended Fix
CI/CD Integration,"Missing CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)","Add a .github/workflows/build-test-deploy.yml file to automate builds, tests, and releases"
Testing,No unit or integration tests detected,"Write tests for Kotlin buttons, Python logging, and JS build scripts using JUnit, pytest, or Mocha respectively"
REST API,No HTTP endpoint handling logic found (backend not exposed as service),"Implement an API layer if needed for remote interactions (e.g., Flask for Python or Ktor for Kotlin)"
Documentation,Good deployment docs; lacks developer README or onboarding guide,"Add a README.md with setup, architecture diagram, and usage instructions"
Security,No credential or environment variable management observed,Introduce .env files and use secure vaults for API keys or signing credentials
Build Portability,"Separate scripts for desktop and Android, but no unified interface",Create a top-level Makefile or CLI interface to choose platform and trigger builds

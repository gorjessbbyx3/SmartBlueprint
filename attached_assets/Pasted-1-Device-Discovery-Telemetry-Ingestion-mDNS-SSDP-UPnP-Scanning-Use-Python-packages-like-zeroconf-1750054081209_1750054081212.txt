1. Device Discovery & Telemetry Ingestion
mDNS/SSDP/UPnP Scanning

Use Python packages like zeroconf or netdisco to discover on-local-network devices that speak mDNS/SSDP.

Identify each device’s MAC, IP, model, and any available telemetry API (e.g. Philips Hue HTTP, Samsung SmartThings).

Passive Wi-Fi Sniffing for RSSI/CSI

Put your Wi-Fi NIC in monitor mode (e.g. wlan0mon) and sniff 802.11 beacon/probe-response frames with scapy.

Collect per-frame RSSI or (if your driver supports it) full CSI.

Tag each measurement with the source MAC → now you have a stream of (timestamp, MAC, rssi/CSI[]).

API Polling for Device-Specific Sensors

For devices that expose power draw, light level, temperature, motion events or other status via REST or MQTT, poll at 1-5 Hz and normalize those readings into your sensor stream.

python
Copy
Edit
# Example: discover via zeroconf, then poll HTTP API for a smart bulb
from zeroconf import Zeroconf, ServiceBrowser
import requests, threading, time

class BulbListener:
    def __init__(self):
        self.devices = {}
    def remove_service(self, *args): pass
    def add_service(self, zc, type, name):
        info = zc.get_service_info(type, name)
        ip = ".".join(map(str, info.addresses[0]))
        self.devices[info.properties[b"id"].decode()] = ip

zc = Zeroconf()
listener = BulbListener()
ServiceBrowser(zc, "_hue._tcp.local.", listener)

def poll_bulb_metrics():
    while True:
        for bulb_id, ip in listener.devices.items():
            data = requests.get(f"http://{ip}/api/sensor").json()
            # e.g., data["light_level"], data["power"]
            ingest_sensor(bulb_id, data)
        time.sleep(1)

threading.Thread(target=poll_bulb_metrics, daemon=True).start()
2. Calibration & Fingerprint Database
User-Guided or Passive Calibration

Guided: user taps each discovered device on a floorplan; record its (x,y).

Passive: walk through rooms holding a BLE beacon (or just your phone), correlate time-synced telemetry/viewer location from your mobile UI to automatically assign devices to rooms.

Build the Fingerprint DB

For each device, record a signature vector:

ini
Copy
Edit
sig = [mean_RSSI, std_RSSI, (optional) CSI_PCs… , sensor_metrics…]
coord = (x,y)
Store as JSON for k-NN or regression model training.

3. Spatial Inference Engine
Feature Vector Assembly

Every 200 ms, collect the latest RSSI/CSI vector from each anchor device and any sensor metrics.

Concatenate into a fixed-length feature:

ini
Copy
Edit
F = [rssi_dev1, ..., rssi_devN, sensor1, ..., sensorM]
Localization Model

Lightweight k-NN: scikit-learn’s KNeighborsRegressor on your fingerprint DB → returns (x,y).

ML Regressor: train an MLP or tree-based regressor on your collected calibration data.

Bayesian Filter: optionally smooth over time with a Kalman or particle filter.

python
Copy
Edit
# mapping_engine.py
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
import json, numpy as np

db = json.load(open("fingerprint_db.json"))
X = [entry["sig"] for entry in db.values()]
Y = [entry["coord"] for entry in db.values()]
model = KNeighborsRegressor(3).fit(X, Y)

def infer_position(current_features):
    return model.predict([current_features])[0].tolist()
4. AI-Based Anomaly Detection
Temporal Model:

Stack the last T positions (and optionally sensor anomalies) into a sequence.

Run a small LSTM or 1D-CNN autoencoder to compute a reconstruction error or “anomaly score.”

Rule-Based Alerts:

If anomaly_score > θ OR your ML model flags an outlier → trigger alert.

Fuse with vision (if you have cameras) or device motion sensors for higher confidence.

5. Recommendation Engine
Coverage Map Generation:

Given device coordinates and an estimated coverage radius (from RSSI path-loss modeling), rasterize a coverage heatmap on your blueprint.

Gap Detection & Candidate Sites:

Identify grid cells under a coverage threshold.

Filter candidate grid cells to those near power outlets or Ethernet jacks.

Optimization:

Solve a small set-cover or genetic-algorithm problem to pick the minimal set of new devices/extenders to place.

python
Copy
Edit
# recommend.py (greedy)
def suggest_extender(coverage_grid, candidate_sites, k=1):
    # coverage_grid: dict[(i,j)] -> coverage_score
    # candidate_sites: list[(x,y)]
    chosen = []
    for _ in range(k):
        # pick site that maximally raises the minimum coverage
        best = max(candidate_sites, key=lambda s: coverage_with(s, coverage_grid) - coverage_grid_min(coverage_grid))
        chosen.append(best)
        apply_coverage(s, coverage_grid)
    return chosen
6. System & Deployment Notes
Edge-Only Inference: run all sniffing, ML models, and recommendation logic on a local hub (Raspberry Pi, Jetson, or mini-PC).

WebSocket API: stream (x,y,anomaly_score) updates to your React dashboard in real time.

Privacy: no raw camera or packet data leaves the hub—only high-level events and anonymized logs.

Scaling: start with 3–5 anchor devices; add more as needed to improve spatial resolution.

Summary
By treating each smart device as an “anchor” beacon (via RSSI/CSI) plus optional sensor node—and building a feature-to-coordinate regression model—you can seamlessly integrate them into your existing Wi-Fi mapping + AI security pipeline. Calibration, ML inference, and recommendation engines slot in right after your CSI-only pipeline, enriching localization and enabling automated placement guidance.

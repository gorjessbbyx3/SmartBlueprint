| Component                        | Role                                                                     | Status |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| 🌐 **Web App**                   | Central cloud dashboard for device management, WiFi mapping, and control | ✓ Active |
| 💻 **Desktop Agent**             | Local LAN scanner + tunnel + device bridge                               | ✓ Built |
| 📶 **Smart Devices**             | Controlled/discovered by agent; data syncs with cloud                    | ✓ Integrated |
| 🔁 **Cloud Sync Tunnel**         | WebSocket/HTTPS tunnel connecting agent to cloud                         | ✓ Active |

### Why Desktop Agent is Required (Browser Security Limitations)

**Browser Security Restrictions:**
- WiFi signal strength (RSSI) access blocked
- Network interfaces sandboxed (no packet sniffing)
- MAC addresses / IP neighbors inaccessible  
- File system and OS-level resources restricted
- Local device discovery prohibited for security

**Agent-Only Capabilities:**

| Feature | Requires Agent | Technical Reason |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| WiFi Signal Scanning | ✅ | Uses platform CLI tools (nmcli, netsh wlan, iwlist) |
| ARP/Ping Scanning | ✅ | Raw sockets and broadcast scans blocked in browsers |
| MQTT Connectivity 24/7 | ✅ | Requires persistent background process |
| Smart Device Discovery | ✅ | Needs system-level UDP listeners (mDNS, SSDP) |
| Local AI Anomaly Detection | ✅ | Requires persistent state and direct telemetry access |
| Network Topology Mapping | ✅ | Browser cannot access gateway ARP tables |
| Secure Router Pairing | ✅ | Needs OS-level routing and DHCP query access |

**Architecture Analogy:**
- **Web App** = Command center (UI/control, dashboards, visualization)
- **Local Agent** = Field technician (scanner, messenger, watchdog)
- **MQTT** = Communication layer (walkie-talkie between components)
- **Smart Devices** = Workers (respond to commands, provide telemetry)

### Meta-AI Monitoring System - ACTIVE ✓

1. **Meta-AI Monitor** - Oversees all 7 AI systems, detects issues, generates fixes
2. **Virtual Test Environment** - Tests fixes safely before applying to live system

4. **Automatic Fix Application** - Applies successful solutions without human intervention
5. **Real-time Fix Queue** - Visible on analytics page showing AI maintenance activities
